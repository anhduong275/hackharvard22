Have you ever felt so annoyed that you have to discuss with your roommates or family members about how to split up daily repeating tasks, ON TOP OF THAT random new stuff you need to take into account for?
Fret no more, Household Task Allocator is here for the rescue! Our project is named a 'Household Task Allocator', or 'Family Planning' - your choice :) We allow you flexibility in number of family members, number of daily or nondaily tasks, and the POWER to randomly allocate your tasks! Let the universe decide.
